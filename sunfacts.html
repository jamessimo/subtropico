				<h2>Skin &amp; Sun Facts</h2>
				<dl>
		
					<dt><span>Q.</span> What are UVA, UVB, UVC and IR Rays ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> These are types of light waves emitted by the sun. 
					 
					UV-A radiation has a wavelength between 320 and 400 nanometers, and takes longer to reach our skin. They penetrate the epidermis (top layer of the skin) and reach the dermis (lower layer), where they can kill skin cells, and destroy the connective tissue. 
					Most sunscreens do a good job blocking UVB but few filter out most of the UVA. 
					There is ongoing research into active ingredients and their effectiveness against UVA radiation. 
					
					 
					UV-B radiation has a wavelength between 290 and 320 nanometers, and therefore reaches our skin sooner. As UV-B has a higher energy of light, it is one of the main causes of sunburn, premature ageing of the skin and skin cancer (especially in combination with UVA).UV-B rays penetrate the epidermis to activate the melanocyte cells that produce melanin, which gives us a suntan. 
					 
					UV-C radiation has a wavelength between 200 and 290 nanometers. They are the most dangerous rays as they sterilise and kill small organisms. They have the shortest wavelength, but are presently screened out by the Ozone Layer. However, with further damage to the Ozone Layer, UV-C rays could become very pervasive. 
					 
					IR (Infrared) radiation has a longer wavelength between 760 and 3000 nanometers. 
					IR rays, and can also be harmful to the skin, and are linked with basal cell carcinoma and ageing of the skin. </dd>
				</dl>
			
				<dl>
					<dt><span>Q.</span> How can I prevent being sunburned ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Always use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with Sun Protection Factor that suits your skin, and one that will block both UV-A and UV-B. Apply it thirty minutes before sun exposure.
					Try to avoid the sun between 10:00h and 15:00h, as this is the period when the suns rays are at their strongest and avoid reflective surfaces.
					Wear long sleeved shirts and a wide brimmed hat. 
					</dd>
				</dl>		
				<dl>
					<dt><span>Q.</span> What does SPF mean?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> SPF means Sun Protection Factor. It was established by the Food and Drug Administration of America (FDA) to ascertain the amount of UV-B protection in any given sun screen product.
					If your skin can withstand the suns rays, for say 10 minutes without burning and without using the sun screen, the number after a product that has a Sun Protection Factor of say 10, indicates that applying an SPF 10, your skin can stay in the sun up to 10 times longer without burning.
					
					NB. Always reapply the product after being exposed for the recommended time, as this will help continue it's protection.
					 
					</dd>
				</dl>	
				
				<dl>
					<dt><span>Q. </span> What are sunscreens ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Sunscreening agents either absorb, scatter or block harmful Ultra Violet rays, and in doing so helps prevents them from damaging the Epidermis and Dermis layers of the skin. These products are formulated to provide various levels of protection against UV-A, UV-B, and IR rays. The SPF of a product was introduced by The Food and Drug Administration to measure its UVB sunburn protection. 
					
					 
					</dd>
				</dl>			
				
				<dl>
					<dt><span>Q. </span> What are Photostable Sunfilters ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> A photostable UV filter is stable to UV radiation i.e. it's chemical structure is not degraded by exposure to the suns rays.

				<h2>Getting &amp; Maintaining a Tan</h2>
				
				<dl>
					<dt><span>Q.</span> How do I choose the correct product for my skin ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Take into consideration the following:
					
					Your geographic location-the closer to equator the stronger the sun. 
					The time of day-between 10:00h and 15:00h is the period when the suns rays are at their strongest.
					Your elevation-at high altitudes the suns rays are more intense. For every 1000 metres the suns strength increases by 10%.
					The current condition of your skin-see the following table:
					Skin type	Effect	Use
					Pale white skin	That always burns never tans	Very high SPF
					White skin	That burns easily and tans minimally	Very high SPF
					White skin burns moderately	Tans gradually to a light tan	High SPF
					Lightly tanned	Burns minimally and always tans	Medium/High SPF
					Medium brown/well tanned	Rarely burns/tans easily and deeply	Medium SPF
					Dark brown/black	Never burns	Low SPF
					 
					The above information is only a rough guide relating to normal skin types. The selection of any product remains the responsibility of the person concerned. If in doubt, always consult your doctor.
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				
				<dl>
					<dt><span>Q.</span> How can I prevent Lip Blisters ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Always use a Lip Balm of SPF 30 Plus, such as <a href="products.html#lip-46">Sub Tropic Ski'n'Swim SPF 46 Plus</a>. Make sure that it is reapplied after eating, drinking or swimming, because product is often removed after these activities.
					</dd>
				</dl>
				
				
				<dl>
		
					<dt><span>Q.</span> If I am fair-skinned, how do I get a tan?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Most fair skins suffer some degree of sunburn when trying to obtain a tan. However, this also puts them at greater risk of getting skin cancer. We recommend that fair skinned people use our Tan Accelerator Gel, which contains an Amino Acid Complex of Tyrosine, Adenosine, Collagen and Riboflavin, two days before starting to sunbathe.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>	
					<dt><span>Q.</span> When should I apply sunscreen ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Apply it thirty minutes before sun exposure. Reapply after swimming or sweating. 
					Always follow the instructions on the bottle. </dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>	
					<dt><span>Q.</span> How should I apply sunscreens ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Apply to all areas to be exposed to the sun. To reduce possible discomfort from over exposure, apply higher factors to those parts of the body where the skin folds with body movement-for example, elbows, armpits, back of the knee joints, neck and around the borders of your swimwear.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>	
					<dt><span>Q.</span> Do I need to use a sunscreen when it's cloudy ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Yes! Even if the sun is not shining! UV radiation is reflected off many different surfaces, and can often increase its intensity. Water, rocks, sand, snow, fog and ice are just a few to mention.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>	
					<dt><span>Q.</span> Do I really need to use an After Sun or moisturiser after sunbathing ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Yes, most definitely! After exposure to the sun, wind and water, your skin becomes dehydrated and loses its valuable natural oils. These oils need to be replaced to help the skin to become supple again. 
					Keeping your skin well moisturised, also helps the prevention of peeling and premature ageing.
					
					</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>	
					<dt><span>Q.</span> How can I keep my tan for longer ?</dt>
					<dd><span>A.</span> Use a good quality aftersun moisturiser, such as Sub Tropic's After Sun 'E' Tan Protector, which contains cooling, soothing anti-ageing properties. This will help to preserve and prolong your tan. Use it after every tanning session, and see the difference!
					Also excellent as an all year around moisturiser!
